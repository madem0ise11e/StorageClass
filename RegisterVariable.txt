The register keyword is used to declare register variables.
Register variables were supposed to be faster than local variables.
However, modern compilers are very good at code optimization,
and there is a rare chance that using register variables will make your program faster.
Unless you are working on embedded systems where you know how to optimize code for the given application,
there is no use of register variables.
